# Extended Persistence-Based Conway’s Game of Life

(the Italian version is available in file [README_it.md](README_it.md)).

## Overview

The system models an extended version of the [Game of Life (GOL) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) as a series of evolving cell configurations. The project provides a basic GOL implementation, and its purpose is to extend it.

# Cells

In the provided basic game, cells follow the standard GOL rules. The extended implementation enriches this basic model by introducing specialized cell types with distinct metabolic behaviors. Certain cells can delay death in underpopulation or overpopulation scenarios, surviving multiple generations under stress. Other specialized cells tolerate different neighborhood conditions, thriving either in isolation or in crowded environments. Additionally, cells exchange energy with neighbors, representing life points or resources influencing their evolution.

# Board

The basic board consists of a grid holding a set of tiles, where each tile holds a cell. In its extended form, the board has interactive tiles, capable of absorbing or donating energy to cells. These interactions can impact cell behaviors, and it is necessary to perform analyses to assess the board’s evolving properties and states.

# Game

In its basic version, the game operates by simulating the standard GOL evolution, managing cell interactions based on neighbors' states from a given initial configuration. All tiles hold a cell that remains the same along the simulation, toggling its state between alive and dead. The extended implementation introduces global events affecting all tiles and cells across the board at specific generations. These events, which include different scenarios, dramatically alter the board's state and cell dynamics.

# Persistence

The state of the extended GOL must be persistently stored and retrievable using `JPA`/`Hibernate` with an in-memory `H2` database. Entities are saved and can be reloaded later, enabling inspection or resumption of the simulation at any given generation.

## Detailed Requirements

The Extended GOL project provides from the start an implementation of the basic GOL to be extended.

### Provided Code

GOL classes:

- `ExtendedGameOfLife`: a facade class where methods required for testing are stubbed.
- `Cell`: represents a cell in a generation.
- `Tile`: represents a tile on the board.
- `Board`: represents a simple static game board.
- `Game`: defines the simulation context.
- `Generation`: representation of a game state.
- `Interactable` and `Evolvable`: the interfaces required to be implemented by some of the entities
- `CellType`, `CellMood` and `EventType`: `enum`s including the foreseen typologies of cell types, cell moods and event types, respectively, in the extended game.
- `Coord`: embeddable, hashable `JPA` value object that encapsulates integer `(x, y)` coordinates, with proper `equals()` and "hashCode()" overrides to use it as a key in maps and sets.
- `ExtendedGameOfLife`: a custom exception class for the extended GOL

- Persistence:

  - `JPAUtil`: provides a singleton-based utility to manage the `EntityManagerFactory`
  - `GenericExtGOLRepository`: a generic repository class to be implemented by entity-specific repository classes.

## R1 Cells

### Basic Behavior

In the provided basic game, cells follow the classical GOL rules:

- **Survival:** A live cell with two or three alive neighbors lives to the next generation.
- **Death by underpopulation:** An alive cell with fewer than two alive neighbors dies.
- **Death by Overpopulation:** An alive cell with more than three alive neighbors dies.
- **Respawn:** A dead cell turns alive when having exactly three alive neighbors.

The game board is considered to be finite: cells on corners have 3 neighbors, cells on edges have 5 neighbors, and central cells have 8 neighbors.

To model interactions with other cells and the environment, cells must implement an interface called `Evolvable`. The project provides the basic version of the cells through the `Cell` class, implementing `Evolvable`, and contains an override of its `evolve()` method supporting classical GOL rules.

### Extended Behaviors

#### Specialized Cell Types

Each cell has a `lifePoints` attribute, representing the energy level of the cell. The base `Cell` class has this attribute set to the default value `0`.
The extended GOL implements three different cell types as derived classes of the `Cell` class:

- `Highlander`: it can survive for three generations in GOL-related death-inducing conditions.
- `Loner`: Thrives in isolation, moving the lower bound of survival conditions to `1` neighbor only.
- `Social`: It moves the upper bound of survival conditions up to a maximum of `8` neighbors.

All cells have a `cellType` attribute, and basic cells are marked as `BASIC`.

At each generation, the `evolve()` method updates the cell's `lifePoints` according to its neighborhood and interactions.

- Death decreases it by one
- Survival-maintaining conditions increase it by one
- Respawn resets its lifePoints to 0

In addition to the basic GOL rules compliance, a cell needs to have 0 ore more in order to be alive. Yet, cells in death-inducing conditions according to GOL die even if they have positive energy levels. Dead cells do not update lifepoints otherwise.

#### Vampires and healers

Each `Cell` can have three moods: `NAIVE`, `HEALER`, or `VAMPIRE`. When two cells interact, by implementing `Interactable`, depending on their respective mood, different outcomes follow:

- `HEALER` + `NAIVE`: The `HEALER` generates 1 lifePoint for the `NAIVE`.
- `HEALER` + `HEALER`: Nothing happens.
- `HEALER` + `VAMPIRE`: The `VAMPIRE` absorbs 1 lifePoint from the `HEALER`.
- `VAMPIRE` + `VAMPIRE`: Nothing happens.
- `VAMPIRE` + `NAIVE`: The `VAMPIRE` absorbs 1 lifePoint from the `NAIVE` and turns them into a `VAMPIRE`.
- `NAIVE` + `NAIVE`: Nothing happens.

All cells have a `cellMood` attribute. The mood can change multiple times for the same cell, depending on its interactions with other `Cell`s on the `Board` and the events that occur during a `Game`.

#### Persistence

All `Cell`-derived classes, as well as the base class, must be annotated as `JPA` entities, ensuring that the entire cell hierarchy can be saved and loaded through your `JPA` repositories. The provided generic repository class `GenericExtGOLRepository<E,I>` must be implemented parametrizing it for `Cell` to provide basic operations and a load method so that the `Cell`’s state is persistently stored and retrievable via `JPA`. For example:

```java
public class CellRepository  extends GenericExtGOLRepository<Cell, Long> {
    public CellRepository()  { super(Cell.class);  }
}
```

Each repository must implement the `load(...)` method (and any custom queries) so that the board’s and game’s full state can be saved and reloaded via `JPA`.

---

## R2 Board

### Basic Behaviors

The board is a grid with fixed dimensions (`M×N`), corresponding to `M*N` instances of simple `Tile` objects with coordinates `x` and `y`, each one holding a single `Cell`.

### Extended Behaviors

#### Interactive Tiles

On the `Board`, each `Tile` has a `lifePointModifier` attribute value, by default `0`, and implements the `Interactable` interface. `Tile`s can have different impacts on the `Cell`'s `lifePoints`, depending on the `lifePointModifier` attribute value: if they have a positive `lifePointModifier` they adding its current value to the `lifePoints` to the cell, if it is negative they subtract, and if it is zero they have no effect. Interactions with the tile impact the cell at the beginning of each generation.

#### Visualization

The `Board` supports string-based visualization through the method `visualize()`. Each `Tile` hosting a dead `Cell` is represented with a `0`, while `Cell`s on the board are represented with:

- `Cell`: `C`
- `Highlander`: `H`
- `Loner`: `L`
- `Social`: `S`

This method produces visualizations with the following format:

```
0C00H
L00CS
0H000
C0000
```

### Analytical Methods

The `Board` class provides the following analysis methods. Each accepts a `Generation` instance (or generation range) and returns the requested information:

| Method Signature                                                                         | Description                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `public Integer countCells(Generation gen)`                                              | Returns the **total number** of alive cells in `gen`.                                                                |
| `public Cell getHighestEnergyCell(Generation gen)`                                       | Finds the **single** cell with the highest `lifePoints`, picks the one closer to the top left corner in case of tie. |
| `public Map<Integer, List<Cell>> getCellsByEnergyLevel(Generation gen)`                  | Groups **alive cells** by their current `lifePoints`.                                                                |
| `public Map<CellType, Integer> countCellsByType(Generation gen)`                         | Counts alive cells **per** `CellType`. Tip: use custom querying in the dedicated repository.                         |
| `public List<Cell> topEnergyCells(Generation gen, int n)`                                | Returns the **top `n`** cells sorted by descending `lifePoints`.                                                     |
| `public Map<Integer, List<Cell>> groupByAliveNeighborCount(Generation gen)`              | Groups cells by their **number of live neighbors**.                                                                  |
| `public IntSummaryStatistics energyStatistics(Generation gen)`                           | Computes summary statistics (`count`, `min`, `max`, `sum`, `average`) over all cells’ `lifePoints`.                  |
| `public Map<Integer, IntSummaryStatistics> getTimeSeriesStats(int fromStep, int toStep)` | Returns a **time series** of energy statistics for each generation step in `[fromStep, toStep]`.                     |

#### Persistence

The `Board`'s complete configuration must be fully persistable: all entities must be annotated with appropriate ID and relationship mappings.
The provided generic repository class `GenericExtGOLRepository<E,I>` must be implemented parametrizing it for Board to provide basic operations and a load method so that the board’s state, including the position and complete states of `Cell`s and `Tile`s it holds, is persistently stored and retrievable via `JPA`. For example:

```java
public class BoardRepository  extends GenericExtGOLRepository<Board, Long> {
    public BoardRepository()  { super(Board.class);  }
}
```

## Each repository must implement the `load(...)` method (and any custom queries) so that the board’s and game’s full state can be saved and reloaded via `JPA`.

## R3 Game

### Basic Behaviors

The `Game` orchestrates the evolution of the `Board` along `Generation`s using standard GOL rules and basic cell behavior.
This starts with setting the initial `Board` configuration and performing the game evolution routing until a target number of `Generation`s is reached. The routine includes:

1. **Neighbor Detection**: At initialization, scan the `Board` to determine each cell's neighbors.
2. **Neighborhood evaluation**: The `Game` triggers every `Cell` to evaluate the aliveness states of its neighbors at the current `Generation`.
3. **Evolution**: The `Game` sets the new state according to GOL rules of each `Cell`for the next `Generation` following the neighborhood evaluation.

### Extended Behaviors

#### Events

The extended `Game` can trigger global events setting the state of all `Tile`s on the `Board` for a single `Generation`. Possible events are:

- **Cataclysm**: all `Tile`s reset all `lifePoints` from the `Cell` they hold to `0`.
- **Famine**: all `Tile`s absorb exactly `1` `lifePoints` from the `Cell` they hold.
- **Bloom**: `Tile`s grant exactly `2` `lifePoints` to the cells sitting on them.
- **Blood Moon**: every `VAMPIRE` seated on a `Tile` automatically absorbs `1` `lifePoints` from each adjacent `NAIVE` or `HEALER` and turns them into new `VAMPIRE`s.
- **Sanctuary**: all tiles grant each `HEALER` `1` `lifePoints`, while blocking all `VAMPIRE`s by turning them `NAIVE`.

Each event impacts a single generation. Each generation includes at most one event. Events impact all cells on the board at the beginning of each generation.

#### Persistence

The persistence layer must capture every Generation snapshot (board layout and cell states) together with its associated `Game` entities. Upon loading, `loadEvents()` is responsible for querying and re-attaching each event to the corresponding `Generation` in the Game, thereby fully restoring the simulation’s timeline and enabling replay or inspection. The provided generic repository class `GenericExtGOLRepository<E,I>` must be implemented parametrizing it for `Game` to provide basic operations and a load method so that the `Game`’s state, including all of its `Generation`s and events, is persistently stored and retrievable via `JPA`. For example:

```java
public class GameRepository  extends GenericExtGOLRepository<Game, Long> {
    public GameRepository()  { super(Game.class);  }
}
```

Each repository must implement the `load(...)` method (and any custom queries) so that the board’s and game’s full state can be saved and reloaded via `JPA`.
